#### [Github.io page](https://jason-michael.github.io/project1/) | [Repo](https://github.com/jason-michael/project1)

#

### Team:
- Justin Kane - Frontend design
- Douglas Boyce - Leaflet integration
- Jason Michael - Javascript

#

### Our APIs:
- [Open Notify](http://open-notify.org/) - International Space Station location info.
- [Google Geocoding](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start) - latitude/longitude coordinates from addresses.

#

### New Tech:
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) - open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.
- [CORS Anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere) - NodeJS proxy which adds CORS headers to the proxied request.
    - This was needed as the open-notify API does not support https.
